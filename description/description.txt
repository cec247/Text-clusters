The attached sketch folder contains a processing.js (http://processingjs.org/) sketch. To view it:

(instructions are for OSX)
1) open Terminal
2) cd to the directory containing the sketch
3) run this command: "python -m SimpleHttpServer"
4) Open your web browser and point it to http://0.0.0.0:8000

The file sketch.png is a screenshot of the sketch when it is running.

This processing sketch was whipped together to explore a data set.
The data set is raw text from ~90,000 survey responses. 
One of my colleagues identified 5 "clusters" in the responses. These clusters are groups of "similar" responses.
The goal of this visualization is to show which terms are associated with which clusters, and if there's an overall meaning or sentiment associated with each cluster.

The file data.js contains a summary of the data:
    var terms: an array of the terms used in the data. (these have been stemmed, so some of them aren't real words)
    var counts: the number of clusters each term appears in. This ranges from 1 to 5.
    var clusters: An array of 5 subarrays. Each subarray corresponds to a cluster. 
        Each subarray consists of indexes into the terms array, which tells you which terms the cluster contains.

Your mission: 
    1) Critique the original sketch -- how can it be improved?
    2) Come up with one or more of your own ideas for visualizing this data, and describe them. 
       Include sketches (photos of paper sketches is fine).
    3) For full points, either implement your improvements from 1), or one of your ideas from 2).
       Return a screenshot of your sketch along with the code.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
